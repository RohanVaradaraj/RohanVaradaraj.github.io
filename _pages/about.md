I am a PhD student at the University of Oxford working on the evolution of galaxies in the first 1.5 billion years of the Universe. I use imaging from some of the largest ground-based telescopes such as Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and VISTA to search for rare, massive and luminous star-forming galaxies at high-redshift. I have also used <em> JWST </em> to measure resolved properties, such as sizes, of bright distant galaxies. More recently as a member of the Euclid Consortium working with the newly launched <em> Euclid </em> telescope, I have been exploring imaging data from this next-generation observatory.
